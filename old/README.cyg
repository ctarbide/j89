Jove for Cygwin
=================

On modern Cygwin (at least 1.7 onwards, tested recently on 3.1.2),
either for Cygwin32 or Cygwin64,
	make SYSDEFS=-DCYGWIN_JTC TERMCAPLIB= XEXT=.exe
should work (Jove's new builtin JTC termcap replacement should work fine
on the cygwin console and any terminal emulators shipped with cygwin)

It should also work fine with the Cygwin ncurses package if support
for ancient non-ANSI/non-VT1xx terminals is desired for some reason.
	make SYSDEFS=-DCYGWIN TERMCAPLIB=-lncurses XEXT=.exe

Older/obsolete notes from the original port to Cygwin32, for historical record.
==============================================================================-=

Jove has been ported to the Cygwin32 environment using the GNU-Win32 tools.
Cygwin32 is a POSIX API for Win32, developed by Cygnus Solutions, Inc.  The
GNU-Win32 tools are Win32 ports of the GNU development tools for Windows NT
and 95, built using the Cygwin32 API.  For more information on the Cygwin32
project and the GNU-Win32 toolset, consult

	http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32

Jove was originally ported to the environment by Arlindo da Silva.  A more
complete port was done, based on Arlindo's work, by Dave Curry.

The regular UNIX Makefile is used, with remarkably few changes
to definitions:
- XEXT=.exe
- XINSTALL=install $(INSTALLFLAGS) -c -m 755
- TINSTALL=install $(INSTALLFLAGS) -c -m 644
- SYSDEFS=-DCYGWIN32
- TERMCAPLIB = -L/usr/local/lib -lcurses
Search for Cygwin32 in the Makefile.

The environment used for the port was GNU-Win32 Beta 19.1 and the EGCS 2.90.27
compiler set, and Windows 95.  You'll need either GNU Termcap 1.3 or ncurses
to build from source.

Note that you may want to set the CYGWIN32 environment variable to "tty" so
that the CTRL-C key doesn't get treated as an interrupt.

[Addendum from Mark Moraes, 2013 April]

I recently built jove on a Cygwin environment (1.7.18) with the
default cc (gcc 3.4.4), and noted that our instructions in README.*
and Makefile are slightly obsolete.  With the changes/notes below,
jove 4.16.0.73 seemed to compile and run fine with

	make SYSDEFS=-DCYGWIN32 TERMCAPLIB=-lcurses XEXT=.exe

1. Rather than building 'GNU Termcap 1.3 or ncurses' from source, all
one needs to do is include the ncurses-devel package when installing
Cygwin.

2. Setting CYGWIN=tty is no longer needed, it seems, since the cygwin
default shell runs under mintty which emulates a terminal.  (Once upon
a time, I used to have to set TERM=ansi to avoid some sort of
redisplay misbehaviour, it currently says TERM=xterm and I wonder if
that misbehaviour still exists, I'll have to search my archive to see
what it was).  Or just use xterm or rxvt...
