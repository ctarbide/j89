/* Format of records within the jrec file: information to allow
 * recovery from a crash.
 *
 * Note: the recovery info is
 * (1) architecture dependent -- it contains longs, among other things
 * (2) version dependent -- format 1 started in 4.15.16, version 2 in 4.17.2.8
 * (3) configuration dependent -- affected by any change to FILESIZE
 * RECMAGIC tries to encode all those things so we can at least detect
 * mismatches (and perhaps, down the road, at least recover different
 * configurations.
 * Even though this uses long, which might be 64bits, we keep RECMAGIC
 * to fit in 32bits, so that it can fit on most machines. Similarly,
 * we only use long as a field width, to make this more uniform;
 * wastes bits on 64bit machines (which can afford it) but is nice
 * for 32bit machines (or even 16bit, since their long is usually 32bits)
 * The bulk of any jrec file is the daddr pointers anyway.
